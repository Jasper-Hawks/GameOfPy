# Jasper's Game of Py
Based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), Jasper's Game of Py is Conway's Game of Life made entirely in Python 3.

## Installation

## Issues and contributing
This is the final upload of the project but if you discover any bugs that I may have overlooked feel free to open an issue.

## What I learned and could have improved upon
I learned how to combine all of the basics that I knew about python into a project that was fun but challenging. I also need to improve upon planning my projects out since the majority of issues that arose were from shortsightedness.
